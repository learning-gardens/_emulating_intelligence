# Emulating Intelligence

A machine learning and artificial intelligence learning group

## Overview

This is mostly a placeholder at the moment, but I think this learning group could be structured around five threads:

- the practical: how to build software using AI/ML
- the theory: the underlying concepts that power the algorithms
- the social: the possible or present impacts of the deployment of AI systems
- the philosophical: if desired we can also talk about implications AI has for the place of humans, consciousness, etc
- the integration: how experiences/interactions with AI are designed

I think that covers it?

## Structure

The "practical" thread might be tricky to pull of since it would require a several hours together (if it's structured as workshops). Another possible arrangement is we all agree to e.g. learn one framework with regular goals/check-ins and we each learn them independently (though we of course can help each other out with learning e.g. via Slack).

I'd also say we should stick to a single language (Python) to minimize overhead of jumping around different languages.

A big open question is how do we organize a course that has some very technical material for people of many different backgrounds in a way that isn't too lecture-focused and more discussion-oriented?

## Syllabus

I think the syllabus could be based off of [my AI notes](http://frnsys.com/ai_notes/) but those are mostly focused on theory. So it would need to be supplemented with the "practical" thread (I think that can be informal though), the "social" thread (I have a stash of readings on those that I'll drop in here at some point), and the "philosophical" thread (I don't have much there tbh).
